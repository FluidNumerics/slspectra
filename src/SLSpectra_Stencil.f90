   TYPE, ABSTRACT :: Stencil
     !! The Stencil class is an abstract class that lays out the structure for defining a 
     !! discrete computational stencil. The Build method for this abstract class is deferred
     !! intentionally. The Free method is provided so that you don't have to add your own
     !! Free method for a type extended class.
     !!
     !! Adding a specific stencil requires that you declare a type extension of
     !! the Stencil class and then concretize the Build type bound procedure.
     !! When using a specific stencil, you simply have to declare your object as one of the
     !! concretized types.
